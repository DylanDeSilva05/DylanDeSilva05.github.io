                    This website was created as part of a university-level web development project.

                <p>
                    Students both from Australia and abroad need a platform which guides their search for the top universities across
                    Australian cities as well as school rankings and specific disciplines. The selection of a university represents
                    a crucial step in life that we simplify through accurate and organised information.
